# weather-dashboard

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard that allows users to search for a city and see its current and future weather conditions. The motivation for this project is to provide a tool for travelers to plan their trips more effectively by having up-to-date weather information for multiple cities. By using the OpenWeather API and localStorage, the dashboard retrieves weather data for cities and stores persistent data for future use. Through this project, I learned how to work with APIs and use localStorage to store data.

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Jalzu1007/weather-dashboard.git

3. Register for a new API key from OpenWeatherMap.

4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API key as API_KEY=yourapikey.

3. Navigate to the repository's directory using the command:

 cd weather-dashboard

5. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Enter a city name in the search bar and click the search button or press enter.
2. The dashboard will display the city's current weather conditions, including the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
3. The dashboard will also display a 5-day forecast that shows the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
4. The searched city will be added to the search history, which is stored in localStorage.
5. To view weather conditions for a city in the search history, click on the city name.
